    -ml_fit is an example of a maximum likelihood fit to an ensemble of trajectories.

    -simulated_data_N5a, 5b, and 5c contain simulated trajectories of 5 fluorophores.

    -The parameters used in each set of simulations are shown in simulated_data_param_table.png.

    -The table uses different labels than the directory names. Here's the mapping between them:
        Set 1 = N5a
        Set 2 = N5b
        Set 3 = N5c

Running example
---------------

    1. To run ml_fit, first unzip the directories::

        tar xzf ml_fit.tgz
        tar xzf simulated_data_N5a.tgz
        tar xzf simulated_data_N5b.tgz
        tar xzf simulated_data_N5c.tgz

    2. See the README within ml_fit for further instructions.
